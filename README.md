## Supported Temperature Scales

### Celsius (°C)
Water freezes at 0°C and boils at 100°C. Most commonly used worldwide for scientific and everyday temperature measurements.

### Fahrenheit (°F)
Water freezes at 32°F and boils at 212°F. Primarily used in the United States for weather and everyday temperature measurements.

### Kelvin (K)
Absolute temperature scale where 0K represents absolute zero (-273.15°C). Widely used in scientific applications and physics.

### Réaumur (°Ré)
Historical temperature scale where water freezes at 0°Ré and boils at 80°Ré. Previously used in parts of Europe.

### Rankine (°R)
Absolute temperature scale using Fahrenheit degree increments. Commonly used in engineering applications, particularly in the United States.

## Usage Instructions

1. Open index.html in a modern web browser
2. Enter a temperature value in the input field
3. Select the source temperature unit from the dropdown
4. View instant conversions to all other temperature scales
5. Click any result card to use that value as new input
6. Use preset buttons for common temperature values
7. Utilize keyboard shortcuts for enhanced productivity

## Conversion Formulas

The application uses precise mathematical formulas for all conversions:

**Celsius to Fahrenheit:** °F = (°C × 9/5) + 32
**Celsius to Kelvin:** K = °C + 273.15
**Celsius to Réaumur:** °Ré = °C × 4/5
**Celsius to Rankine:** °R = (°C + 273.15) × 9/5

All conversions are performed through Celsius as the intermediate scale to ensure accuracy and consistency.

## Design Philosophy

The application follows modern web design principles with emphasis on:
- User experience and intuitive interaction
- Visual hierarchy and clear information presentation
- Accessibility and responsive design
- Performance optimization
- Professional aesthetic appeal
